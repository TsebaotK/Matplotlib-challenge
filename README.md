An anti-cancer medication study was done on 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors. These mice were given a range of drug regimens, and the tumor development was observed and measured over 45 days. From the study data, the following are observed. 

Observations
1.	Compared to other drugs, more tests were made on mice that were given the Capomulin & Ramicane drugs. However, no outliner was observed in these drugs.
2.	Out of the studied drugs, lower average tumor volume and lower deviation from the mean are observed in mice that were given the Capomulin & Ramicane drugs. 
3.	Focusing on the Capomulin drug, mice with heavier weights are observed to have a higher tumor volume.
4.	Over the study period, mice with the Capomulin drug showed an increase in tumor size in the first 20 days, followed by a sharp decrease. However, an increasing trend has been seen in the last ten days.
